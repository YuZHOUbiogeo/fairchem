    "### Are predictions from FAIRChem models deterministic?\n",
    "\n",
    "By deterministic, we mean that multiple calls to the same function, given\n",
    "the same inputs (and seed), will produce the same results.\n",
    "\n",
    "On CPU, all operations should be deterministic. On GPU, `scatter` calls -- which\n",
    "are used in the node aggregation functions to get the final energy --\n",
    "are non-deterministic, since the order of parallel operations is not uniquely\n",
    "determined [[1](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.scatter_.html),\n",
    "[2](https://pytorch-scatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions/scatter.html)].\n",
    "Moreover, results may be different between GPU and CPU\n",
    "executions [[3](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html)].\n",
    "\n",
    "To get deterministic results on GPU, use [`torch.use_deterministic_algorithms`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.use_deterministic_algorithms.html#torch.use_deterministic_algorithms)\n",
    "where available (for example, see [`scatter_det`](https://github.com/FAIR-Chem/fairchem/blob/main/src/fairchem/core/common/utils.py#L1112)). Note that deterministic operations are often slower\n",
    "than non-deterministic operations, so while this may be worth using for testing\n",
    "and debugging, this is not recommended for large-scale training and inference.\n",
