    "        Where `$DIR` specifies the directory to save generated LMDBs. A sub-directory will be created for each of the 4 splits in `$DIR`. `$NUM_WORKERS` is the number of data preprocessing cpu workers to be used.\n",
    "    4. Update your energy-only config to point the test set to the newly generated LMDBs. Using the trained energy-only S2EF model, generate predictions via `--mode predict` (as you would do for the general IS2RE/S2EF case).\n",

    "EvalAI expects results to be structured in a specific format for a submission to be successful.

Construct submission files for the OC22 S2EF-Total/IS2RE-Total tasks as follows:\n",

    "### S2EF-Total/IS2RE-Total:\n",
    "1. Run predictions `--mode predict` on both the id and ood splits, generating `[s2ef/is2re]_predictions.npz` files for each split.\n",
    "2. Run the following command:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python make_submission_file.py --dataset OC22 --id path/to/id/file.npz --ood path/to/ood_ads/file.npz --out-path submission_file.npz\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   Where `file.npz` corresponds to the respective `[s2ef/is2re]_predictions.npz` files generated for the corresponding task. The final submission file will be written to `submission_file.npz` (rename accordingly). The `dataset` argument specifies which dataset is being considered — this only needs to be set for OC22 predictions because OC20 is the default.\n",
    "3. Upload `submission_file.npz` to EvalAI."
