    "To introduce OCP we start with using it to calculate adsorption energies for a simple, atomic adsorbate where we specify the site we want to the adsorption energy for. Conceptually, you do this like you would do it with density functional theory. You create a slab model for the surface, place an adsorbate on it as an initial guess, run a relaxation to get the lowest energy geometry, and then compute the adsorption energy using reference states for the adsorbate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do have to be careful in the details though. Some OCP model/checkpoint combinations return a total energy like density functional theory would, but some return an \"adsorption energy\" directly. You have to know which one you are using. In this example, the model we use returns an \"adsorption energy\"."
