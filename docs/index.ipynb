    "- This codebase was initially forked from [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn)\n",
    "by [Tian Xie](http://txie.me), but has undergone significant changes since.\n",
    "- A lot of engineering ideas have been borrowed from [github.com/facebookresearch/mmf](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mmf).\n",
    "- The DimeNet++ implementation is based on the [author's Tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/klicperajo/dimenet) and the [DimeNet implementation in Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/torch_geometric/nn/models/dimenet.py).\n",
    "- It was then developed as the OCP repo, and includes many contributions from the community and collaborators.\n",
    "- Much of the documentation was developed for various papers or as part of a comprehensive tutorial for the 2023 ACS Fall Chemistry conference.\n",
